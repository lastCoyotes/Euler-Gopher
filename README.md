# Euler's Grab Bag
Project Euler with a twist.

This is my attempt at Project Euler; the catch is that I have to use a new language for each problem.

# Languages Used
Full details of the solutions will be listed below, but for the sake convenience, here is an alphetized list of languages used so far.

# Completed Challenges

# Constraints

Brainf**k derivatives and clones will be considered identical to Brainf**k and will not be used.

Lisp derivatives are considered distinct. For example, Racket, ELisp, and Common Lisp will all be considered as distinct options.

Any languages I have wrote personally will not be used for this challenge.

Interpreters and compilers are taken as it is. Bugs in a chosen compiler are to be treated as intended beahvor. One caveat is in the case of historical code, where some modifications will be necessary to get a language interpreter written long ago to work on a modern computer.

# Final Notes
You'll notice that I seldom use any mainstream languages. This is not because I'm trying to make this challenge harder than needs be; it is rather to be used as "lifelines" for more difficult problems later in the Project Euler archive that will require more powerful and easier to use languages than an esoteric language.

By no means does this project mean I'm fluent in any of the languages I choose for the problem, but rather the challenge of learning new methods of computing and having a deeper understanding of what computing data is.

Yap.
