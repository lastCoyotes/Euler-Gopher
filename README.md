# Euler's Gopher
Project Euler entirely in Go.

This is my attempt at Project Euler to challenge myself to use Go. Only the first 100 problems will be shared publically to respect Project Euler's rule on sharing. Problems larger than 100 will be kept in a private repository.

# Notes
Originally this project was intended to use a unique language for each problem (coined: Euler's Grab Bag/Euler's Melting Pot) but I had decided that as fun as that would be, I wanted to learn Go moreso. I had used Go in a few projects in university in the past and had really loved using it and what I had learned.

Yap.
