# Euler's Gopher
Project Euler entirely in Go.

This is my attempt at Project Euler to challenge myself to use Go.

# Completed Challenges

# Final Notes
Originally this project was intended to use a unique language for each problem (coined: Euler's Grab Bag/Euler's Melting Pot) but I had decided that as fun as that would be, I wanted to learn Go moreso. I had used Go in a few projects in university in the past and had really loved using it and what I had learned.

Yap.
